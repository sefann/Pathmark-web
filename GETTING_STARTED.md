## üìù Optional: Add Your Own WordPress Blog

For your actual deployment, you'll want your own WordPress:

#### Step 1: Install WordPress

Choose one of these options:

**A. On a Subdomain (Recommended)**
- Install WordPress on `blog.yourdomain.com`
- Hostinger has a 1-click WordPress installer
- Keeps your blog separate and easy to manage

**B. On Separate Hosting**
- Use WordPress.com (free tier available)
- Or install on any hosting provider
- Just need the REST API URL

#### Step 2: Configure WordPress

1. **Install WordPress** (via Hostinger control panel or WordPress.com)
2. **Create a test post** to verify it works
3. **Get your REST API URL:**
   - Your URL will be: `https://yourdomain.com/wp-json/wp/v2`
   - Replace `yourdomain.com` with your actual domain
4. **Test it in browser:**
   - Visit: `https://yourdomain.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts`
   - You should see JSON data

#### Step 3: Configure Your Project

1. **Create `.env.local`** (if not exists):
   ```bash
   touch .env.local
   ```

2. **Add your WordPress URL:**
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_WORDPRESS_API_URL=https://yourdomain.com/wp-json/wp/v2
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FORMSPREE_ENDPOINT=https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID
   ```

3. **Restart dev server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## üìã Set Up Contact Form (2 Minutes)

**Quick Setup:** See **`FORMSPREE_QUICKSTART.md`** for step-by-step guide!

Or follow these quick steps:

1. **Sign up at Formspree:** https://formspree.io/
2. **Create a new form** named "Pathmark Contact Form"
3. **Copy the endpoint URL** (looks like: `https://formspree.io/f/xyzabc123`)
4. **Add to `.env.local`:**
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FORMSPREE_ENDPOINT=https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_ACTUAL_FORM_ID
   ```
5. **Restart dev server:** `npm run dev`
6. **Test:** Visit http://localhost:3000/contact

**Full Guide:** See `FORMSPREE_SETUP_GUIDE.md` for detailed instructions

## ‚úÖ Verify Everything Works

After setting up, check:

1. **Blog page loads:** http://localhost:3000/insights
   - You should see blog posts (either from demo or your WordPress)
   - No errors in the console

2. **Contact form loads:** http://localhost:3000/contact
   - Form should be visible
   - Submit will work after Formspree is configured

## üéØ What's Next?

### For Local Development:
- ‚úÖ Use the demo WordPress URL for now
- ‚úÖ Continue building/testing your site
- ‚úÖ Set up your own WordPress before deployment

### For Production Deployment:
You'll need:
1. ‚úÖ Your own WordPress site (with posts)
2. ‚úÖ Formspree account (for contact form)
3. ‚úÖ Build the site: `npm run build`
4. ‚úÖ Upload `out` folder to Hostinger

---

## üêõ Still Having Issues?

### No errors! The site works great
- Fallback articles display automatically
- No configuration needed to start developing
- WordPress is optional (add it when you're ready)

### Need Help?
- Check `ENVIRONMENT_CONFIG.md` for detailed environment setup
- Check `HOSTINGER_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` for deployment help
- Check `STATIC_DEPLOYMENT_README.md` for quick reference

## üìÅ Your `.env.local` Should Look Like This:

```env
# WordPress Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_WORDPRESS_API_URL=https://yourdomain.com/wp-json/wp/v2

# Formspree Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_FORMSPREE_ENDPOINT=https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID

# Optional: Google Analytics
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX
```

**Important:** 
- ‚úÖ Never commit `.env.local` to Git (it's already in `.gitignore`)
- ‚úÖ Replace placeholders with your actual values
- ‚úÖ Always restart dev server after editing `.env.local`

---

## üéâ Quick Commands Reference

```bash
# Create .env.local file
touch .env.local

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# The built static site will be in the 'out' folder
```

---

**That's it!** Once you create `.env.local` with a WordPress URL (even the demo one), the error will be gone and you can continue developing! üöÄ

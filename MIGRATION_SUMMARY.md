# Static Export Migration Summary

Your Next.js website has been successfully converted from a server-side app to a static export that can be deployed on Hostinger Cloud hosting!

## 🎯 What Changed

### 1. **Next.js Configuration** ✅
- **File:** `next.config.ts`
- **Changes:**
  - Added `output: 'export'` for static export
  - Disabled image optimization (required for static export)
  - Removed API route headers (not needed anymore)
  - Added `trailingSlash: true` for better static hosting compatibility

### 2. **Sanity CMS → WordPress REST API** ✅
- **Removed:**
  - All Sanity dependencies (`@sanity/*`, `next-sanity`, `sanity`)
  - Sanity configuration files in `src/sanity/`
  - API route: `/api/sanity/posts`
  
- **Added:**
  - New WordPress integration: `src/lib/wordpress.ts`
  - Client-side WordPress post fetching
  - Transformed WordPress data to match previous Sanity structure

- **Files Updated:**
  - `src/app/insights/page.tsx` - Now fetches from WordPress
  - `src/app/insights/[slug]/page.tsx` - Converted to client-side component

### 3. **Resend → Formspree** ✅
- **Removed:**
  - Resend dependency (`resend`)
  - API route: `/api/contact`
  
- **Updated:**
  - `src/app/contact/page.tsx` - Now posts to Formspree endpoint

### 4. **Removed API Routes** ✅
All API routes have been deleted (not compatible with static export):
- `/api/contact/` - Replaced with Formspree
- `/api/insights/` - RSS fetching removed (optional to re-implement client-side)
- `/api/sanity/posts/` - Replaced with WordPress REST API
- `/api/test-env/` - Not needed

## 🚀 How to Deploy

### Quick Start

1. **Set up WordPress:**
   ```bash
   # Install WordPress on your domain or subdomain
   # Enable REST API (it's on by default)
   # Add your first blog post
   ```

2. **Set up Formspree:**
   ```bash
   # Sign up at https://formspree.io/
   # Create a new form
   # Copy the form endpoint URL
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables:**
   ```bash
   # Create .env.local in project root
   NEXT_PUBLIC_WORDPRESS_API_URL=https://yourdomain.com/wp-json/wp/v2
   NEXT_PUBLIC_FORMSPREE_ENDPOINT=https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID
   ```

4. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

5. **Build the site:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```
   This creates an `out` folder with all static files.

6. **Upload to Hostinger:**
   - Use File Manager, FTP, or SFTP
   - Upload contents of `out` folder to `public_html`
   - See `HOSTINGER_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` for detailed instructions

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Environment Variables
- All environment variables must start with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` to be accessible in the browser
- Environment variables are **baked into the build** during `npm run build`
- You must **rebuild** the site after changing environment variables
- The `.env.local` file should **NEVER** be committed to Git

### WordPress Integration
- Your WordPress REST API must be publicly accessible
- The site makes client-side API calls to fetch blog posts
- Posts are fetched when users visit the insights page
- No server-side rendering - all content loads in the browser

### Contact Form
- Formspree handles all form submissions
- No server-side code required
- Forms are submitted directly to Formspree
- You'll receive email notifications for new submissions

### Removed Features
- **RSS Feed Aggregation:** The industry news section that pulled from RSS feeds has been removed (API routes aren't compatible with static export)
  - You can add this back using a client-side RSS library or third-party widget
- **Server-side API Routes:** All removed, site is now purely static + client-side JavaScript

## 📊 Feature Comparison

| Feature | Before (Sanity + Resend) | After (WordPress + Formspree) |
|---------|--------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Blog CMS | Sanity (headless) | WordPress REST API |
| Contact Form | Resend (Node.js) | Formspree (external service) |
| Deployment | Needs Node.js server | Static files only |
| Hosting | Vercel, specialized hosts | Any web hosting (Hostinger) |
| Build Output | Server + static | Only static files |
| Environment | Server + client | Client-side only |
| Updates | Rebuild + redeploy | Just upload new files |

## üöÄ Deployment Notes

### For Local Development
```env
# .env.local (NOT committed to Git)
NEXT_PUBLIC_FORMSPREE_ENDPOINT=https://formspree.io/f/xyzabc123
```

### For Production Build
The endpoint is **baked into the build**, so:

1. Set `.env.local` with correct endpoint
2. Run `npm run build`
3. Upload `out` folder to Hostinger
4. Form will work on production!

**Important:** Environment variables are compiled at build time. If you change the Formspree endpoint, you must rebuild.

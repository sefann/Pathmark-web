# 🚀 Static Deployment - Quick Start

Your Next.js website has been converted to a **static export** that works perfectly on Hostinger Cloud hosting!

## 📋 What You Need

1. **WordPress Site** - For blog posts
   - Can be on a subdomain (blog.yourdomain.com) or separate hosting
   - REST API must be enabled (it's on by default)
   
2. **Formspree Account** - For contact form
   - Free tier available at https://formspree.io
   
3. **Hostinger Hosting** - For static files
   - Any shared/cloud hosting plan works

## ⚡ Quick Setup (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Configure WordPress

```bash
# 1. Install WordPress on your domain
# 2. Create a test post
# 3. Verify REST API works:
#    Visit: https://yourdomain.com/wp-json/wp/v2/posts
#    (Should show JSON data)
```

### Step 2: Configure Formspree

```bash
# 1. Sign up at https://formspree.io
# 2. Create a new form (name it "Contact Form")
# 3. Copy your endpoint URL (looks like: https://formspree.io/f/xyzabc123)
```

### Step 3: Set Environment Variables

Create `.env.local` in project root:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_WORDPRESS_API_URL=https://yourdomain.com/wp-json/wp/v2
NEXT_PUBLIC_FORMSPREE_ENDPOINT=https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID
```

### Step 4: Build Static Site

```bash
# Install dependencies (only needed once)
npm install

# Build the site
npm run build

# Static files are now in the 'out' folder!
```

### Step 5: Upload to Hostinger

**Option A: File Manager (Easiest)**
1. Log in to Hostinger Control Panel
2. Open File Manager
3. Go to `public_html`
4. Upload ALL files from the `out` folder
5. Done! Visit your domain

**Option B: FTP (Recommended)**
1. Get FTP credentials from Hostinger
2. Connect using FileZilla
3. Upload contents of `out` folder to `public_html`
4. Upload `public/.htaccess` to `public_html` (for clean URLs)

## ✅ Verify Everything Works

After uploading, check:
- ✅ Homepage loads: `https://yourdomain.com`
- ✅ Blog posts load: `https://yourdomain.com/insights/`
- ✅ Contact form works: `https://yourdomain.com/contact/`
- ✅ Check browser console (F12) for any errors

## 🔄 Making Updates

### Updating Blog Content (No Rebuild Needed!)
1. Log in to WordPress
2. Create/edit posts
3. Changes appear immediately on your site

### Updating Site Pages (Requires Rebuild)
1. Edit files in `src/`
2. Run `npm run build`
3. Re-upload `out` folder to Hostinger

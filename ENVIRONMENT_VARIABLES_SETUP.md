   - Click on your project
   - Go to "Settings" tab
   - Click on "Environment Variables" in the left sidebar

3. **Add Each Variable**
   ```
   Name: NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID
   Value: your-actual-project-id
   Environment: Production (check this box)
   ```

   ```
   Name: NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET
   Value: production
   Environment: Production (check this box)
   ```

   ```
   Name: SANITY_API_TOKEN
   Value: your-actual-api-token
   Environment: Production (check this box)
   ```

4. **Save and Redeploy**
   - Click "Save" after adding each variable
   - Go to "Deployments" tab
   - Click "Redeploy" on the latest deployment

### **Method 2: Via Vercel CLI**

```bash

## üìã Quick Checklist

- [ ] Create `.env.local` file locally (for testing)
- [ ] Get Sanity Project ID from Sanity dashboard
- [ ] Create Sanity API token with read/write permissions
- [ ] Set all 3 environment variables in Vercel dashboard
- [ ] Redeploy your project
- [ ] Test that the website loads correctly

---

## üß™ Testing Locally First

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root:

```bash
# .env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=production
SANITY_API_TOKEN=your-api-token
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_USE_CDN=false
```

Then test locally:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

1. **Never commit `.env.local`** - it's already in `.gitignore`
2. **Use Production environment** in Vercel for live deployment
3. **Redeploy after adding variables** - changes won't take effect until redeploy
4. **Keep your API token secure** - don't share it publicly

---

## üÜò Troubleshooting

**If your site doesn't load after deployment:**
1. Check Vercel deployment logs for errors
2. Verify environment variables are set correctly
3. Ensure your Sanity project is accessible
4. Check that the API token has correct permissions

**If you get "Project not found" errors:**
- Double-check your Project ID
- Ensure the project is in the correct Sanity account

**If you get "Unauthorized" errors:**
- Check your API token is correct
- Verify token has read/write permissions
- Make sure token hasn't expired

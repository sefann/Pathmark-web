## üìã Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Prepare Environment Variables
```bash
# Create a file named: hostinger-env.txt
# Copy this template and fill in your actual values:

NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=production
SANITY_API_TOKEN=your_api_token
RESEND_API_KEY=re_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
CONTACT_EMAIL_TO=contact@pathmarkadvisory.com
CONTACT_EMAIL_FROM=noreply@pathmarkadvisory.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID=G-XXXXXXXXXX
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=https://yourdomain.com
NODE_ENV=production
```
**Save this file locally - you'll copy/paste into `.env.local` on the server**

### Step 2: Upload Files
Choose one method:

**Option A: Git (Recommended)**
- [ ] Push code to GitHub/GitLab
- [ ] Clone on server via SSH

**Option B: FTP Upload**
- [ ] Connect via FileZilla or Hostinger File Manager
- [ ] Upload all files to `~/public_html/Pathmark-web/`
- [ ] Don't upload: `node_modules/`, `.next/`, `.git/` (if large)

### Step 3: SSH Deployment
- [ ] Connect to server via SSH
- [ ] Navigate to project directory
- [ ] Create `.env.local` file
- [ ] Run deployment script: `bash deploy-hostinger.sh`

### Step 4: Configure Server
- [ ] PM2 process running
- [ ] Nginx/Apache reverse proxy configured
- [ ] Port 3000 forwarding to domain

### Step 5: SSL Certificate
